    "I was born healthy — a kid who loved running, jumping, and dancing. But at eight years old, polio changed everything. Both of my lower extremities were paralyzed. For nearly a year I was in hospitals and therapy, my family anxious, my future uncertain. The active kid who once ran around became someone who would never walk again.",
    "I questioned myself, my parents, and God. But eventually I decided that the hard reality didn't have to define me. With my eyes closed, hands on my wheels, and heart hopeful, I slowly started overcoming every fear. I asked myself: will my disability hinder me from pursuing my dreams?",
    "The answer was no. I went to college, graduated with a BS in Information Technology, gave the graduation speech, and was hired by my school as an instructor. I took my master's while I taught. I had a career. But something was still missing — purpose.",
    "That purpose was found in serving the PWD sector. I founded Behind the Rolling Chair to champion accessibility and inspire others living with disability. Through it I have reached thousands — from school-supply drives in far-flung communities to national policy tables and international disability gatherings.",
    "Today I sit on the Regional Development Council XI as the private sector voice for Persons with Disability and Senior Citizens. I run a travel agency that promotes accessible tourism and a Cebuana Lhuillier bills-payment center — consistently top-ranked in the Davao region — where I deliberately hire people with disabilities. My life's purpose is clear: keep going, keep pushing, keep making a difference.",
