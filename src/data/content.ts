    "At eight years old, polio paralyzed both my lower extremities. For nearly a year, I was in hospitals. The active kid I once was was replaced by someone who would never walk again. I questioned everything. But eventually, I made a decision: my disability would shape my life, but it would not define my future.",
    "That decision changed the direction of my life. I pursued a BS in IT, delivered the graduation speech, became a college instructor, earned a master's degree, and received an Australia Awards Scholarship to Curtin University. Along the way, I realized my purpose wasn't just to succeed—it was to create opportunities for others.",
    "I founded Behind the Rolling Chair to champion accessibility, served on the Regional Development Council XI, launched an accessible-tourism travel agency, and opened a top-performing Cebuana Lhuillier branch where I intentionally hire people with disabilities. Today, everything I do is driven by one belief: disability should never limit someone's opportunity to live, work, or thrive.",
